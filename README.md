# Delivered
Delivered is a 2D Platform game which tells the story of D, the envelope. D has to go through some small (or big) challenges so he can find his Mailbox.

The game has 4 different levels, which are the easy level (2 rooms), medium level (1 room, mini boss), hard level (1 room, enemies are bigger, run faster and have more hp), and the final level (final boss, has much more hp, a little bit slower than the hard level enemies, but shoots every 30 frames).

In this game, D has an infinite number of bullets (mini-envelopes), which are shot by clicking  the left-mouse button and aiming your mouse to the desired place to shoot at.
